## RStudio Cheatsheets

[Data Wrangling with dplyr and tidyr](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

One of several cheat sheets available on the RStudio website, it provides a
brief, visual summary of all the key functions discussed in this lesson. It also
lists some of the auxiliary functions that can be used within each type of
expression, e.g. aggregation functions for summarize, "moving window" functions
for mutate, etc.
