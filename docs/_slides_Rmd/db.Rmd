## Database Connections

The [dplyr](){:.rlib} package reads data from multiple kinds of sources. We used CSV files above, but data could also be read from a database.

To read the "animals" table from a PostgreSQL database server using R as a database client:

```{r title="{{ site.handouts[0] }}"}
library(RPostgreSQL)

con <- dbConnect(PostgreSQL(), host = 'localhost', dbname = 'portal')
animals_db <- tbl(con, 'animals')
```

The "localhost" is not a typical location for a database server (because "localhost" means your own system). If you have a database administrator, that person will give you the correct host and credentials. If you do not have a database administrator, [here you go](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

Many of the exact same operations can be performed *by the database* system, because the [dplyr](){:.rlib} functions map to standard structured query language (SQL) operations.

```{r title="{{ site.handouts[0] }}"}
species_month_prop <- animals_db %>%
    group_by(species_id, month) %>%
    summarize(count = n()) %>%
    mutate(prop = count / sum(count)) %>%
    select(-count)
```

```{r}
species_month_prop
```

===

To complete the pivot table, however, the `species_month_prop` values must be copied into a R data.frame using `collect` for processing with `spread`. There is no SQL equivalent for what `spread` does.

```{r title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
pivot <- species_month_prop %>%
  collect() %>%
  spread(month, prop, fill = 0)
```

===

Always disconnect from a database when finished. Terminating an R session works too.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
