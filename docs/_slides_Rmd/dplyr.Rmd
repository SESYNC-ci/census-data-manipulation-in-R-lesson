## Key dplyr functions

| Function    | Returns                                            |
|-------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| `filter`    | keep rows that staisfy conditions                  |
| `select`    | keep columns with matching names                   |
| `group_by`  | split data into groups by an existing factor       |
| `mutate`    | apply a transformation to existing [split] columns |
| `summarize` | summarize across rows [and combine split groups]   |

The table above presents the most commonly used functions in [dplyr](){:.rlib}, which we will demonstrate in turn, starting from the `cbp` data frame.

## Subsetting

The cbp table includes numeric `year` and `month` columns. Of the 35,549 observations, lets see how many observations are left when we keep only observations from the first three months of 1990.

```{r lib, message = FALSE, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
library(dplyr)
```

===

```{r filter, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
animals_1990_winter <- filter(
  animals,
  year == 1990,
  month %in% 1:3)
```

===

```{r view_filter}
str(animals_1990_winter)
```

Note that a logical "and" is implied when conditions are separated by commas. (This is perhaps the main way in which `filter` differs from the base R `subset` function.) Therefore, the example above is equivalent to `filter(animals, year == 1990 & month %in% 1:3)`. A logical "or" must be specified explicitly with the `|` operator.

To keep particular columns of a data frame (rather than choosing rows) , use the `select` with arguments that match the column names.

```{r}
names(cbp)
```

===

One way to "match" is by including complete names, each one you want to keep:

```{r eval=FALSE}
select(animals_1990_winter,
  id, month, day, plot_id,
  species_id, sex, hindfoot_length, weight)
```

===

Alternatively, we can use a negative "match": keep columns that do not match the name preceded by minus sing.

```{r select, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
animals_1990_winter <- select(
  animals_1990_winter,
  -year)
```

Use this option to remove a single column from a data frame.

===

```{r view_select}
str(animals_1990_winter)
```

To complete this section, we sort the 1990 winter animals data by descending order of species name, then by ascending order of weight. Note that `arrange` assumes ascending order unless the variable name is enclosed by `desc()`.

```{r arrange, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
sorted <- arrange(animals_1990_winter,
                  desc(species_id), weight)
```

```{r view_arrange}
head(sorted)
```

## Exercise 2

Write code that returns the `id`, `sex` and `weight` of all surveyed individuals of *Reithrodontomys montanus* (RO).
