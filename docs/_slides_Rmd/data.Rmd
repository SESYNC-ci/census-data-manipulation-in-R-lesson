To learn about data transformation with dplyr, we need more data. The Census
Bureau collects subnational economic data for the U.S., releasing annual [County
Business Patterns (CBP)] datasets including the number of establishments,
employment, and payroll by industry. They also conduct the [American Community
Survey (ACS)] and publish, among other demographic and economic variables, estimates of
median income for individuals working in different industries.

library(data.table)
cbp <- fread('data/cbp15co.csv')

See the [CBP dataset documentation] for an explanation of the variables we don't
discuss in this lesson.

Modify the import to specify what string in the CSV file represents NAs,
a.k.a. data that is not-available or missing.

```{r read_data_na, title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}', results = 'hide'}
cbp <- fread(
  'data/cbp15co.csv',
  na.strings = c())
```

Question
: What changed?

Answer
: {:.fragment} Using `str()` shows that the character string `""` in the CSV file
is no longer read into R as missing data (an `NA`) but as an empty string.

===

```{r title = '{{ site.handouts[0] }}', results = 'hide'}
acs <- fread(
  'data/ACS/sector_ACS_15_5YR_S2413.csv',
  colClasses = c(FIPS='character'))
```
```{r}
str(acs)
```

===

The two datasets both contain economic variables for each U.S. county and
specified by different categories of industry. The data could potentially be
manipulated into a single table reflecting the follow statistical model.

$$
median\_income \sim industry + establishment\_size
